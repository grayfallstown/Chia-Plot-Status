    Errors: >
        Errors that occured in the plotting process while reading from or writing data to disk.
        The chia plotter will retry in case of such an error after a short Seconds. One is not that bad.
        If you use external harddrives or network attached Storage this usally means the connection
        dropped. Reattach the device and chia will continue. If the error count keeps rising you need to troubleshoot.
    Progress: >
        Shows the progression defined by the number of steps done vs the number of steps left to completion.
        The number of steps tells you nothing about how long the process will take to completion.
    TimeRemaining: >
        An estimate on how long it will take for the plot to complete. It is based on the plots progress and all
        the data extracted from your finished plots. It will try to use the data of those plots that match the
        configuration of that plot most closely to make a better prediction if you mix hard disks, ssd, internal
        and external drives and even network attached storage.
    RunTimeSeconds: >
        "How long the process is running already"
    ETA: >
        An estimate on when the plotting process completes formatted MM/dd HH:mm. It is based on the plots
        progress and all the data extracted from your finished plots. It will try to use the data of those plots
        that match the configuration of that plot most closely to make a better prediction if you mix hard disks,
        ssd, internal and external drives and even network attached storage.
    CurrentTable: >
        The table number currently worked on. On phase 1 and 3 it will start with table 1 and work its way up to 7. In
        Phase 2 it will start with table 7 and work its way back to table 1. An arrow shows in which way it currently
        progresses.
    CurrentBucket: >
        The Chia plotter will work through each table in the phases 1 and 3 and will process each bucket in each table.
        This shows which bucket in the current table is currently worked on.
    CurrentPhase: >
        Shows in which of the four phases the plotting process is. It does not go back to a previous phase.
    Phase1Seconds: >
        The time this plot process took to complete phase 1.
        This is the only phase with multithreading enabled and the only one you can optimize with the threads option.
    Phase2Seconds: >
        The time this plot process took to complete phase 2
    Phase3Seconds: >
        The time this plot process took to complete phase 3
    Phase4Seconds: >
        The time this plot process took to complete phase 4
    CopyTimeSeconds: >
        Unofficial phase 5.
        The time this plot process took to copy the final file to the destination.
        It gets copied from temp folder 2 to destination unless temp folder 2 and the destination are identical.
        If you are using a remote destination you can optimize this process by using a local ssd or even just a
        hdd as destination and then moving the plot to its remote destination by other means.
        This way your plotting process is completed before the plot slowly gets moved to its final destination
        and the plotter can already begin the next plot.
        Google "windows task scheduler" or "linux chron jobs" to see how to set up automatic jobs that move the
        files for you.
    TotalSeconds: >
        The time this plot process took to fully complete
    PlotSize: >
        The k-size of the plot. Usally 32, which produces a 100GB plot file. Apparently there is very little
        reason to use a larger k-size for now.
    Threads: >
        The number of threads used to complete phase 1. As of now the other phases are not multithreaded
        and will only use one cpu core, tweaking this only affects phase 1
    Buffer: >
        This buffer size the plotter uses. It is used to sort the data within the buckets in memory.
        It will resort to a different sort algorithm which is slower on most tables. Too small buffer
        sizes will slow down the plotter, too large ones will bring no additional benefit, but lower
        the number on plotting processes you can run in parallel with the ram installed in your
        system.
    Buckets: >
        The number of parts a table will be split into. Each bucket is sorted individually. Each bucket
        gets written in its own file.
    StartDate: >
        When the plotting process was started.
    FinishDate: >
        When the plotting process finished.
    PlotName: >
        Name of the final plot file.
    LogFolder: >
        The folder in which this log file in stored. If you have multiple log folder for multiple rigs,
        this tells you which rig it is from.
    LogFile: >
        The name of the logfile.
    ApproximateWorkingSpace: >
        An estimate on how much temporary space was used during the creation of the plot.
    FinalFileSize: >
        The size of the finished plot file. Varies little over the same k-size.
    Health: >
        Read catefully! Don't be rushed into making a decision here!
        This feature requires existing logs of finished plots from the same log directory
        to run correctly or it uses default warning thresholds that are pretty much diced at the moment!
        If your system does not update "last modfied at" on files (some deactivate it on SSDs) ignore
        the warnings with time in it. Chia Plot Status doesn't know any better.


        An Estimate on the processes health. In some cases it is not clear if the process is still running,
        this can happen especially in phase 4.


        "⚠ Temp Errors": Usually not so serious, but you need to take action.
        It means the last line in the logfile is a read or write error (look at Errors column).
        You might be out of disk space for temp1, temp2 or the destination, so free up some space.
        Another reason could be your external hard disk / network attached storage is detached or the
        connection is flaky.
        The plotter retries every 5 minutes, so it continues once you fixed the error.


        "⚠ Slow 20m/15m": Usually not serious, just have an eye on it.
        It means last update to the logfile was 20 minutes ago, but Chia Plot Status expected a new log line
        within 15 minutes.
        Process is likely still running.
        Maybe you gave your temp drives more IO than they can handle this time?
        If you only have finished plots that ran on SSDs and this one is on a HDD now, it is expected to be
        slower and throw that warning.
        Chia Plot Status will learn that this drive is slower once this plot is done.


        "⚠ Dead? 40m/10m": This is scary. It means last update to the logFile was way too long ago.
        Process might be still running!
        If your system is not really slow/overtaxed at the moment the process could be dead (check to be sure).
        Chia Plot Status considers it possibly dead until it logs something again.


        "✗ Dead (m)": You manually marked this process as dead.


        "✗ Dead": Ouch. The chia plotter produced a fatal error. There will be something like "Caught plotting
        error" in your logfile or it means the processes is not done and a new process appeared in the same logfile.
        If your logging is not messed up and logging multiple processes in parallel to the same file this means
        the process is dead.
